# Database + SQL

> Database: an organized collection of data. Information is housed in objects called `tables`, with data organized in `rows` and `columns`.

> Relational database: a database that defines relationships between tables of data inside it.

> Advantages of relational databases?
>
> - ability to store much more data compared to spreadsheet applications
> - due to encryption, storage is more secure

> SQL: `Structured Query Language`
> Most widely used programming language for creating, querying, and updating relational databases

> Table: holds data organized into `rows` and `columns`.
>
> - rows: record that holds data on an individual piece of data; can be unlimited
> - columns: field that holds one piece of data about all records; limited to a specified amount
> - unique identifier: used to identify records in a table, these are unique and often numbers
> - having more tables is generally better than having fewer tables where informaiton about multiple subjects is combined

> Data types: can be a number, text, or a date. Different types of data are stored differently and take up different amounts of space. Some operations only apply to certain data types.
>
> 1. `string` or `VARCHAR`: we can store strings (sequence of chars such as letters or punctuation). More common to use `VARCHAR` as it's a more flexible and can store small or large strings
> 2. `integer` or `INT`: we can store whole numbers
> 3. `float` or `NUMERIC`: we can store floats (numbers that include a fractional part)

> Schema: `blueprints` of databases. A schema shows a db's design, such as what tables are included and any relationship between its tables. It also lets users know what data type each field can hold.

> Database storage: the information is physically stored on the hard disk of a server. A server is a centralized computer that performs services via requests made over a network.
